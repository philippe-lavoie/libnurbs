Installation instructions for libnurbs/nurbs++

* Unix:

To generate the configure script, you need several auxiliary
tools.  The version numbers are minimal: later versions should
also work.

	autoconf 2.50 
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/autoconf.html

	automake 1.4
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/automake.html

	libtool 1.4
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/libtool.html


After checking the sources out from git, you need to run the script

	sh autogen.sh

from the top-level source directory (i.e. the one containing this
file).  This needs only to be done once.

To compile the library run:

        ./configure
        make

To install the library run:

        make install

To generate the documentation, you need doxygen (doc generator tool),
which can be found at: http://www.doxygen.org/
To generate the documentation run:

	doxygen Doxyfile

This produces a html documentation as well as tex files.
The html documentation can be found at /html/index.html.
The tex files can be compiled running:

	cd latex
	make

This produces a pdf manual.
